# Lion-Core

Lion-Core is a lightweight yet powerful Python library designed to serve as a foundational framework for machine learning, artificial intelligence, workflow automation, scientific computing, and advanced data management. With a focus on simplicity and extensibility, Lion-Core aims to provide a robust toolkit for complex computational tasks while maintaining a minimal dependency footprint.

## üåü Highlights

- **Minimal Dependencies**: Built with only `Pydantic` as a dependency, ensuring a lightweight and easily maintainable codebase.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Designed from the ground up to be modular and adaptable to a wide range of computational needs.
- **Performance-Focused**: Optimized data structures and algorithms for efficient large-scale data processing.

## üöÄ Current Features

- **Advanced Data Structures**: 
  - `Pile`: A flexible container that combines the best of lists and dictionaries, offering efficient access and powerful querying capabilities.
  - `Progression`: An ordered sequence container designed for high-performance operations on large datasets.

- **Robust Type System**: Leveraging Pydantic for data validation, Lion-Core ensures type safety and data integrity across your entire project.

- **Converter System**: A flexible framework for seamless data conversion between various formats, reducing the complexity of data pipeline management.

- **Element-based Architecture**: A foundational `Element` class that serves as the building block for creating modular and composable components, enabling complex system design with ease.

- **Communication Framework**: A groundwork for inter-component messaging, facilitating the development of distributed and microservices-based applications.

- **Form and Validator System**: Dynamic workflow manipulation tools that allow for flexible and adaptable process designs.

- **Worker System**: Powerful workflow composition capabilities, enabling the creation of complex, multi-stage computational pipelines.

- **Adapted Features**: A suite of capabilities originally developed for lionagi, now being refined and integrated into Lion-Core for enhanced functionality and performance.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap
