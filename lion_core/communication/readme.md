The modules in this folder work together to create a robust communication system within the Lion framework. They handle everything from basic messaging to complex action requests and responses, as well as mail management for inter-component communication.

To use these modules, import the required classes in your code. For example:

```python
from lion_core.communication.message import RoledMessage
from lion_core.communication.action_request import ActionRequest
