# LION Framework: Abstract Base Classes

This folder contains the abstract base classes (ABCs) that form the foundation of the LION framework. These classes define core concepts, characteristics, and behaviors implemented throughout the framework.

Key components:
- `concept.py`: Fundamental abstractions (Tao, AbstractSpace, AbstractElement, AbstractObserver)
- `characteristic.py`: Characteristics like Observable, Temporal, Quantum, and Probabilistic
- `event.py`: Event-based structures (Event, Condition, Signal, Action)
- `observer.py`: Observer classes (BaseManager, BaseExecutor, BaseProcessor)
- `container.py`: Container abstractions (Container, Ordering, Collective, Structure)

These ABCs provide a unified vocabulary and consistent interfaces for the framework, encapsulating core principles of complex systems and quantum-inspired computation. They serve as a flexible foundation for extending the framework and ensuring interoperability between different components.

Developers working on core LION functionality or creating extensions should familiarize themselves with these classes to maintain consistency with the framework's design philosophy.
